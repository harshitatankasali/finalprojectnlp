# vaccine-notebook
An interactive .ipynb notebook about a vaccine sentiment analysis problem. There are 3 target classes: neutral, positive, negative. Dataset was (I assume) scraped from twitter.
# libraries
pandas, nltk, matplotlib, numpy, gensim, wordcloud, scikit-learn
# Improvements remaining
I'm currently exploring custom preprocessing methods and other classification algorithms to improve the final accuracy. The notebook will be updated accordingly. Furthermore, LDA topic modelling will be added.
